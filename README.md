# Stroop-Speed
This game was created using only C#

The idea of the game was inspired by The Stroop Effect. The Stroop Effect, created by
John Ridley Stroop, challenged people to read the color word ("Red, blue, etc..") with a different color attached to that word.
The purpose was to study the automatic process in the brain. This game does the same but with points and 
a timer to make it more fun and interesting. 

This game is made to fit on any device. 
# Play by clicking the .exe file once downloaded!

# Instructions:

To start the game just click anywhere on the main screen menu.

Once in the main game : If the Color and the word match, click on the right side of the screen!

If the color and word DO NOT match, click on the left side of the screen!

There will be labels at the bottom that will show "True" (On the right side), and "False" (On the left side).

To exit the application just push the "Esc" button.

Enjoy!
